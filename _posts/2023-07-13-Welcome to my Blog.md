### Starting off with some thoughts on Across the Spiderverse, and a quick Life update

I was able to witness the spectacle that is ATSV, in theatres a couple weeks ago. It has got me obsessed in a way few movies have had, despite being quite a flawed movie in certain respects! 

The film opens up from Gwen's perspective, laying down a clear foundation and a theme which stays for the rest of the movie: Teenagers in Parental trouble. Self-Love is the track that plays in the background, with Coi Leray's beautiful stop-start vocals making the viewer empathize with Gwen's loneliness. It is a great song with and w/o the context, and is one of my favorites of the album.
