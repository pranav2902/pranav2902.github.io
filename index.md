Hey there, this is Pranav, and Welcome to my site! I am working as an ML Engineer currently at Deep Market Making Inc, and graduated from NYU Courant, with an MS in Computational Science, focussing on Machine Learning, in 2023! 

I am interested in ML Engineering, and applying NLP and Computer Vision to various problems. 

I am an avid Puzzle Solver, having represented India at the World Sudoku and Puzzle Championships from 2015-2019, 2022. On this website, you can find a list of my projects and learnings in ML, my CV, and maybe a few Sudokus and puzzles here and there! :)

## Projects

### [Document LLM Chatbot](https://github.com/pranav2902/DocumentAnalyzerLLM)

* Utilized Selenium to scrape articles from [PartnerTap Support](https://partnertap.zendesk.com/hc/en-us).
* Used LangChain with OpenAI ChatGPT-3.5, to create a Support chatbot.

### [Satellite Image Segmentation using U-Nets - Vision](https://github.com/pranav2902/SatelliteImagesSegmentation_Unet)

* Trained U-Net models with ResNet-18 and ResNet-50 encoders on the LandCover.ai dataset for Satellite Image Segmentation                                                        
* Augmented the given dataset with relevant transformations to balance the dataset, which improved the results.                                                                    
* Compared the performance of Vanilla U-Net model with U-Nets with ResNet encoders, for both the original and Augmented datasets.                                                    
* Obtained a Classification accuracy of 0.88 for U-Net+ResNet-18 model, which is in line with previous benchmarks. 

**Remarks:** This was my course project for Computer Vision at NYU Courant.

### [Unlearning the bias of a Dataset using BERT Models - NLP](https://github.com/pranav2902/Unlearning-the-bias-of-a-dataset)

* Utilized concepts from He et al’s work – (Unlearn Dataset Bias in NLI by Fitting the Residual) to train a BERT model for textual entailment task.     
                                   
* Obtained an accuracy of 0.898 with BERT model on the Stanford NLI dataset, improving upon the benchmark set in He’s work.

**Remarks:** This was my course project for Deep Learning Systems at NYU Courant.

### Emotion Masked Language Modeling

* Reproduced the results of Sosea et al ’s work – (eMLM: A New Pre-training Objective for Emotion Related Tasks), which introduced a new pre-training 
objective, emotion Masked Language Modeling(eMLM) to BERT models to improve their performance specifically for Sentiment Analysis and Emotion 
Detection tasks.                                                                                                                
* Obtained similar results to the paper upon testing on 2 Sentiment Analysis and Emotion detection datasets. 

**Remarks:** This was my course project for NLP at NYU Courant.

### [Whatsapp Chat Analysis](https://github.com/pranav2902/Whatsapp-Text-Analysis)

* Implemented a software for analysing WhatsApp text messages using Python
* Calculated important individual and group-based information such as the message and word count of each person, the most used words and emojis of the person, the busiest and most verbose users, and the average activity of the group chat.
* Visualized frequency plots pertaining to each individual’s messages, and the activity of the Group chat throughout its lifetime.

**Remarks:** Personal Project

### Facial Emotion Detection using Deep Learning

* Implemented a 2 stream Neural Network to consider Micro-Expressions in Facial Emotion Detection.
* Showcased the difference in performance of 2 widely used Emotion Detection Models on Indian and mixed video datasets.
* Implemented procedures for generating spontaneous emotions and created an Indigenous video emotion dataset.
