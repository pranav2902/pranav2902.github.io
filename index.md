Hi, there. Welcome to my site. I am an incoming graduate student at the [Computer Science and Math Department](https://math.nyu.edu/dynamic/masters/ms-gsas/ms-scientific-computing) at New York University.

I am interested in Machine Learning, NLP and Computer Vision. I am a big sports fan, so dont be surprised to see sports related content on my [Github](https://github.com/pranav2902)!
