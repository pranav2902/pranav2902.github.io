Hey there, this is Pranav, and Welcome to my site! I am working as an ML Engineer currently at Deep Market Making Inc, and graduated from NYU Courant, with an MS in Computational Science, focussing on Machine Learning, in 2023! I am interested in ML Engineering, and applying NLP and Computer Vision to various problems. [Github](https://github.com/pranav2902)!

On this website, you can find a list of my projects and learnings in ML, my CV, my thoughts/opinions on various things, and maybe a few Sudokus and puzzles here and there! :)
